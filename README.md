# App-booking-medical-app-web

## Description

This is an web app for booking or scheduling appointment between patients and doctors. Here is the link to the site: https://med-booking-app.netlify.app <br>
Although it can work perfectly without any error, this web's backend is still under development status. If needed, it can be easily changed to production status by modification backend settings.

## Frontend
It is developed with basic HTML, CSS, and JS with some external libraries such as scrollMagic or TweenMax

## Backend
I implement Google firebase for saving the accounts of doctors and patients, and appointments between them. If neccesary, an app can be made for admin to control the number or infomation of doctor.
